Here is the procedure on how to apply them
**Don't forget to make a copy of your current highlighting scheme in case you want to switch back later.**

**step 1 :** Open TeXstudio Application,Navigate to Options on tool bar and click save profile

**step 2 :** Go to the folder directory where would you like to save the theme file,name the file(here it's mytheme) and clik save.So in this case the file will be saved as mytheme.txsprofile

**step 3 :** Now go to file->open and open the file that we have saved just now (mytheme.txsprofile) (tip : make sure that you have selected All files)

**step 4 :** Now replace the text from the line [formats] till end (don't remove the text before [formats]) with your desired theme text, click save and close the file

**Step 5 :** Goto Options once again and press load profile and then select our previous file ( i.e. mytheme.txsprofile)
